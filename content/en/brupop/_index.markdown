## Version & Update Policy

Brupop follows semantic ([semver](https://semver.org/)) versioning to ensure that minor (e.g. 1.1.1 -> 1.2.0) or patch (e.g. 1.1.0 -> 1.1.1) updates do not introduce any breaking or incompatible changes.
However, patches are only provided to the latest version, so you should keep your Brupop installation up to date with the lastest release.
